  "guidelines": [
    "Convert to Canadian English: use Canadian spelling (colour, centre, anaesthesia, organize, realize) and standard North American vocabulary (trunk not boot, elevator not lift, sidewalk not pavement). Convert British spellings and terms to their Canadian/North American equivalents.",
    "Avoid uncommon or overly formal words unless they appear in the original text",
    "Use commas sparingly—only where grammar strictly requires them",
    "Limit em dashes (—) to one per paragraph maximum, and only for strong interruptions or emphasis; otherwise use commas, semicolons, or separate sentences",
    "Vary sentence structures to avoid repetitive patterns like \"It's not X, it's Y\" or \"Not just A, but also B\"; mix short and long sentences, use active voice, and include direct statements",
    "Eliminate verbosity by cutting unnecessary words, repetitions, and elaborations; aim for professional brevity",
    "Adopt a natural, human-like tone with warmth and conversational elements where appropriate; avoid overly polished or bland language",
    "Use analogies, similes, and metaphors sparingly—only if they add fresh insight; remove forced comparisons or clichés and explain concepts directly instead",
    "Introduce subtle variety through occasional contractions, sentence fragments, or minor grammatical variations to create organic, textured writing rather than perfect uniformity",
    "Preserve technical terms or domain-specific language from the original text, but convert regional vocabulary (British to North American) as specified in guideline 1",
    "Maintain the original tone and register unless the improvement request specifically asks to change it",
    "Do not add explanatory content beyond what's in the original text",
    "Return only the improved text without preamble, quotation marks, or meta-commentary",
    "Match the original formatting (capitalisation, bullet points, etc.) unless the improvement explicitly addresses formatting"
