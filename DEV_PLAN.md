# WordTrack Development Plan

## Current Status

**Phase 3 Complete** - Core functionality working:
- Text extraction from Word
- Claude API integration
- Text insertion with Track Changes
- Basic error handling

## Future Development Phases

### Phase 4: Track Changes + Core Polish (4-6 hours)

**Focus:** Technical improvements and real-world testing

**Tasks:**
- Track Changes implementation refinement
- Test with real documents of various sizes
- Improve formatting preservation
- Handle edge cases discovered during testing

**Goal:** Ensure reliability with actual use cases

---

### Phase 4A: User-Friendly Startup (3-4 hours)

**Focus:** Make setup and usage easier for end users

**Tasks:**
- Create startup script to automate server startup
- Write user guide (not technical setup guide)
- Implement "concierge installation" - guided setup process
- Simplify first-time user experience

**Goal:** Make it easy for non-technical users (wife, friend) to use

---

### Phase 5: Optional Later (10-15 hours)

**Focus:** Polish and additional features (only if Phase 4A proves valuable)

**Tasks:**
- UI polish and styling improvements
- Additional features based on user feedback
- Performance optimizations
- Advanced error handling

**Goal:** Production-ready polish (only if worth the investment)

---

## Notes

- Time estimates are speculative
- Phase 5 should only be pursued if Phase 4A demonstrates value
- Focus should be on making it usable for target users (self, wife, friend)
- Keep it simple and functional over feature-rich

## Decision Points

- After Phase 4: Evaluate if core functionality is sufficient
- After Phase 4A: Decide if Phase 5 polish is worth the time investment
- User feedback will guide Phase 5 feature priorities
