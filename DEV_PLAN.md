# WordTrack Development Plan

## Current Status
**Phase 3 Complete** - Core functionality working (text extraction, Claude API, insertion with Track Changes)

## Future Phases

### Phase 4: Track Changes + Core Polish (4-6 hours)
- Refine Track Changes implementation
- Test with real documents (various sizes, edge cases)
- Improve formatting preservation
- Fix issues discovered in real-world use

### Phase 4A: User-Friendly Startup (3-4 hours)
- Startup script (automate proxy + dev server)
- User guide (non-technical, for wife/friend)
- Concierge installation (guided first-time setup)
- Simplify onboarding for non-technical users

### Phase 5: Optional Polish (10-15 hours)
**Only proceed if Phase 4A proves valuable**
- UI polish and styling
- Additional features based on feedback
- Performance optimizations
- Advanced error handling

## Decision Points
- **After Phase 4:** Evaluate if core is sufficient
- **After Phase 4A:** Decide if Phase 5 is worth the investment
- Let user feedback guide Phase 5 priorities

## Principles
- Keep it simple and functional
- Focus on usability for target users (self, wife, friend)
- Time estimates are speculative
